 * additional comprehensible information to help troubleshoot the problem. 
 * The message portion of the body should be present as user interface, event if 
 * customer send an Accept-Language header (en or french ie) we should translate the title part 
 * to customer language if we support internationalization, detail is intended for developer
 * of clients, so the translation is not necessary. If more than one error is need to report , we can 
 * response a list of errors.
